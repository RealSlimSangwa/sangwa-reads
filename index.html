				<p>If I'm being honest, I would probably include all the books from <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> in my Top Picks. But I decided to limit myself to one.<em> A Game of Thrones</em>, by George R. R. Martin, kicks off this epic fantasy series about kings, lords, magic and death. Engaging, witty, and fucking entertaining, Martin has created an immersive fantasy world that keeps the reader invested with every page. Although no character is all good or all bad, you'll find yourself rooting for some and wishing the worst for others. I think it's fair to say that we all have a soft spot for "cripples, bastards and broken things."</p>

				<p class = "julietext"><em>Julie, Me, and Michael Owen Makes Three</em>, by Alan Gibbons, was one of my favourite books growing up. As a diehard Arsenal fan, I never thought I would find myself rooting for Manchester United. But Gibbons has somehow managed to create a book that even the biggest Manchester United haters would enjoy. The main protagonist, Terry Payne, is a relatable character for any football fan in high school. As he tries to balance his love for the beautiful game and the pressures of high school, he falls hopelessly in love with a girl he has hardly spoken to. We've all been there before, haven't we? As you read the book, you'll find yourself frustrated with Terry, feeling sorry for him, but most of all, empathetic.

				<p>Picking your favourite comic book is one of the toughest choices you'll ever have to make. <em>Batman: The Killing Joke</em> is my choice. Written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Brian Bolland, this comic book tells another story about Batman against the Joker. But it's different this time. This dark short story provides us with a detailed origin story for the Joker and the reasons behind his madness. Moore's gritty tone blends excellently with Bolland's gorgeous art. And the ending is just... perfect.</p>

				<p class = "afucktext" >Who thought that a book that tells you that you're not special could be so inspiring? As someone who prefers fiction and has never had strong feelings towards self-help books, <em>the Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck</em> has somehow found its way into my Top Picks. Mark Manson doesn't hold back when he's telling you that you've spent way too long giving a fuck about everything when you should be reserving your fucks for what truly matters. It's actually a lot better than it sounds, and even if you do feel attacked while reading it, you'll be glad you made it to the end. My favourite chapters were: "The Importance of Saying No" and "You Are Not Special." </p>
